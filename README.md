## About
This is a NextJS full stack project that is essentially a chatroom. Users can create account and chat.

## Developer 
I want to emphasis use of TypeScript more along with technologies I have used at work such as websockets. This is to gain
more practice. Typically I design for my projects, but for this one in particular I want to get the front-end up and 
running as fast as possible to place a more emphasis on the backend. Particularly authentication, account creation, and
use the App Router more of NextJS as exploratory features. Overtime, I will improve the UI but I am doing just enough
to get the backend work at the moment. This project started on 7/17/2024.

I am going to officially start treating this as a featured project with appropriate development branches and
release branches once this launches. This will act as a update of my skills as a software engineer at this point in time,
as well as a playground to experiment with different strategies and technologies. Some could be subtle as abstractions or
dynamic components.

## Getting Started (Local)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
